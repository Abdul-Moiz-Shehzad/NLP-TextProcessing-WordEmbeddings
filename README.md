# NLP-TextProcessing-WordEmbeddings

This repository explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, focusing on text preprocessing methods, Word2Vec embeddings, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity calculations. It provides practical examples and code snippets demonstrating how to clean and preprocess textual data, create word embeddings, and perform similarity analysis between documents. This project serves as a comprehensive resource for students and practitioners interested in enhancing their understanding of NLP and its applications in text analysis.
